# Beautiful Coffee NCEE Practice

A very simple, lightweight, pure HTML/JS app that allows you to efficiently study NCEE terms. It does this by automatically randomizing terms and pulling the paired etymological derivatives for you to easily study!

This app uses chance.js to randomize the list in a predictable (seeded) order. See at https://chancejs.com/index.html
