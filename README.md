- Please note: the Beautiful Coffee Whitakers API may be slow on the first load, since the server may have to be woken up due to inactivity. If this happens, please be patient for a few seconds, and the dictionary entry should come online shortly.

Note:
This app is not affliated with the NLVE in any way. The lists and code are deemed accurate, but not 100% guaranteed.
If you'd like to use this app or its code for your own app, please message first! Thank you!
