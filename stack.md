# The Beautiful Coffee Tech Stack!

Interested in what Beautiful Coffee uses for its tech stack? Learn more about it here!
We use:
- Github Pages for the frontend webpage serving
- Heroku to serve Whitakers Words
- FastAPI to serve predictions generated by the Whitakers Program on Heroku
- Chance.js to randomize lists in the NCEE App
- Vue.js to power the page turning functionality in the Aeneid App
- Bootstrap to customize the UI in the Aeneid App
- VS Code with Github Desktop to code the frontend
- Github Actions to automate deployment to Heroku and Pages
- The Local Storage API to remember where you left off in all three apps
- We use https://purifycss.online/ to optimize the css on the Aeneid app - ~95% of bootstrap's css is NOT used in the Aeneid app, so we can save load times by reducing css use.
- We delete the bootstrap js files entirely as well, since the bootstrap components the Aeneid app uses do not require bootstrap's js files, so we can save on performance!
- Prettier is used to format when necessary.
