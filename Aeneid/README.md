# Beautiful Coffee Aeneid Reader


Access is now available at: https://beautiful-coffee.github.io/Aeneid


Wondering what a word means when reading the Aeneid, but it's too inconvenient to have another tab open? Beautiful Coffee Aeneid Reader allows for click to lookup functionality, similar to Perseus or reading on a Kindle/E-reader device, but has the advantage of the whitakers dictionary integrated, which helps you determine the grammatical
significance of the word.


This app uses Vuejs and Bootstrap for its functionality, and is therefore not as lightweight as other Beautiful Coffee apps.


Whitakers dictionary is powered by the Beautiful Coffee Whitakers instance, for more information, see here: https://github.com/beautiful-coffee/Whitakers-Words-API


Note: the dictionary may take additional time on the first load. This is not a bug.
